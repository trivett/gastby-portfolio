I am a full stack developer with a background in journalism and education. 

## My professional history

I currently work for [Fabric Technologies](https://meetfabric.com) in Brooklyn. Here, I am learning the joys of web development without managing servers as well as 

work as a contractor at Google, where I am learning so much and having a lot of fun. I am mostly handling front end development in Angular JS for the Local Guides community.

Before my that, I worked at a small startup called Study Abroad Apartments, where I was the only technical employee for quite some time. This stage of my career also gave me the pleasure of training and mentoring a junior developer fresh out of a web bootcamp.

Prior to that, I had the honor to be a part of 2U, a leading education technology company, for just over two years. At 2U, I got some great experience working with a huge team of top notch developers using Python and PHP, among other things.

Before that, I went through the crucible of General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive program, where I spent three months learning and practicing front and back end web development.

I’ve enjoyed a number of careers before I became a professional web developer. I was a freelance business journalist, a Japanese to English translator, an arts and culture reporter, photographer, and translator in Yokohama while teaching in the city’s public schools, and thats only the non service jobs I’ve worked.

When not in front of a screen, I like to take nice long bike rides, read history, graphic novels, and sometimes both. Please drop me a line to get in touch!
