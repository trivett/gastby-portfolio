[A Small Percentage](http://asmallpercentage.journalism.cuny.edu/) is my capstone project for the Interactive Journalism program at CUNY's Graduate school of Journalism.

The project the impact on the developing world and immigrant communities, improvements in technology, the problems associated with business of sending money, and the measures that are being taken to help lower the price of sending money to maximize the amount that reaches the recipient.

The project includes an [animated infographic](http://asmallpercentage.journalism.cuny.edu/remittances-explained/) (see below), [interactive data visualization](http://asmallpercentage.journalism.cuny.edu/what-the-developing-world-loses-to-remittance-prices/), and video to illuminate the story.
